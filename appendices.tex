\subsubsection{Further Rollingstock Information}
Rail operator Metro Trains Melbourne runs a fleet of over 400 1500V DC4 EMU (electric multiple unit) trains over almost 1,000 kilometres of broad gauge (1600mm) track. The fleet consists of a variety of trains: Commonwealth Engineering Trains (EDI Rail or Alstom refurbishment), the Xâ€™Trapolis 100, Siemens Nexus and most recently, the HCMT (High Capacity Metro Train). Unlike the other two set 3-car EMUs, the HCMT has greater carrying capacity, consisting of seven cars with open configuration, enabling passengers to walk the entire length of the train unimpeded.
