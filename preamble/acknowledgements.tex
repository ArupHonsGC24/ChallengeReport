\chapter{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank our industry supervisor Michael Byrne for his support as we ambitiously took on what he described as "the harder" project option. Through our breakthroughs and roadblocks, he kept us grounded and making progress. We extend our thanks to the Global Challenges course coordinators Dr Djuke Veldhuis, Dr Michael Brown and Dr Rosemarie Herbert for their support this year.

Thank you to the professional transport community who answered our burning questions across the AITPM and TransportCamp conferences. A special thank you to TransportCamp for providing a welcoming space for Katie to present the project, and to Steve Bennett (stevebennett.me) for giving us the iconic name "Who's on Board" (WoB). 

Thank you to the Department of Transport and Planning (DTP) for kicking us off down this path by publicly releasing the detailed passenger counts dataset in March, and for agreeing to share further data with us. This project would not have been at all possible without these solid foundations.

Katie would like to extend her thanks to the wonderful Arup honours team Lauren and Ben. Thank you for listening to my excited rambling, helping me learn Python, and for all of the ways you have supported my lofty dreams. Thank you Lauren for your encouragement and solidarity on the “mystery health problems” front - I would have burnt myself into the dust without your kind reminders to take breaks. Thank you Ben for inspiring me to see the light and joys coding can hold. Maybe one day I will learn how to write code that is somewhat optimised. 

The Arup honours team would like to extend a special thank you to our friends and family for their help and support throughout the various stages of this project. Your encouragement and support has been paramount to the wellbeing of the researchers and success of this project.
